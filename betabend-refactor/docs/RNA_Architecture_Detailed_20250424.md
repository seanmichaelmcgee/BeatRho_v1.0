# RNA 3D Structure Prediction Model: Comprehensive Architectural Analysis (2025-04-24)

## 1. Model Architecture Overview

The RNA 3D structure prediction model follows a transformer-based architecture with specialized components for processing RNA sequences and generating 3D coordinates. The model pipeline consists of the following major components:

### 1.1 High-Level Architecture

```
[Input Features] → [Embedding Module] → [Transformer Blocks] → [IPA Module] → [3D Coordinates]
                                                             ↘ [Confidence Head] → [Confidence Scores]
                                                             ↘ [Angle Head] → [Torsion Angles]
```

### 1.2 Core Components

1. **EmbeddingModule**: Processes input features to create initial residue and pair representations
   - SequenceEmbedding: Maps integer-encoded nucleotides to learned embeddings
   - PositionalEncoding: Provides sinusoidal positional information
   - RelativePositionalEncoding: Encodes distance between position pairs

2. **TransformerBlock** (stacked multiple times): Processes both residue and pair representations
   - Multi-head self-attention for residue representations
   - MLP-based pair update based on residue representations
   - Pre-normalization architecture with residual connections

3. **IPAModule**: Predicts 3D coordinates based on residue and pair information
   - Simple projection in v1, with architecture ready for more complex invariant point attention
   - Maps from residue representations to (x, y, z) coordinates

4. **Prediction Heads**: Generate additional outputs
   - Confidence head: Predicts per-residue confidence scores
   - Angle head: Predicts torsion angles for each residue

## 2. Feature Processing and Data Flow

### 2.1 Input Features

The model ingests several types of features for RNA sequences:

1. **Sequence Features**:
   - Integer-encoded RNA sequence (ACGU → 0123)
   - Embedded into dense vectors via SequenceEmbedding

2. **Dihedral Features** (optional):
   - Four torsion angles per residue (alpha, beta, gamma, delta)
   - May be zeros for test-mode inference

3. **Thermodynamic Features**:
   - Pairing probabilities matrix (seq_len × seq_len)
   - Positional entropy (seq_len)
   - Accessibility scores (seq_len)

4. **Evolutionary Features** (optional):
   - Coupling matrix from mutual information (seq_len × seq_len)
   - Conservation scores (seq_len)

### 2.2 Feature Flow

1. **Feature Loading** (`data_loading.py`):
   - Loads features from .npz files with robust error handling
   - Creates default zeros for missing features
   - Handles temporal cutoffs for validation
   - Supports both test-mode (limited features) and training-mode (all features)

2. **Feature Embedding** (`embeddings.py`):
   - Sequence features → Embedded via learned embedding matrix
   - Position information → Added via sinusoidal encoding
   - All residue features concatenated → Linear projection → Residue representation
   - Pair features (pairing probs, coupling matrix) + relative positions → Linear projection → Pair representation

3. **Feature Transformation** (`transformer_block.py`):
   - Residue representations updated via self-attention
   - Pair representations updated via outer product and MLP
   - Mutual influence between residue and pair representations across blocks

4. **Coordinate Prediction** (`ipa_module.py`):
   - Final residue representations → MLP → 3D coordinates
   - Current implementation is a simplified placeholder for future IPA algorithm

### 3.2 Memory Optimization Techniques

The model employs several memory optimization techniques:

1. **Gradient Checkpointing**: Trades computation for memory by discarding intermediate activations and recomputing them during backpropagation
2. **Mixed Precision Training**: Uses FP16 for operations, reducing memory footprint by ~50%
3. **Adaptive Batch Sizing**: Dynamically adjusts batch size based on sequence length
4. **Curriculum Learning**: Gradually increases sequence length during training

### 3.3 Training Process Enhancements

1. **Curriculum Learning**: The training starts with shorter sequences and gradually adds longer ones
2. **Comprehensive Validation**: Periodic evaluation with both test-equivalent and training-equivalent modes
3. **Gradient Accumulation**: Updates weights after accumulating gradients from multiple batches

## 4. Inference Pathway

The inference pathway in `kaggle_inference_v3.0.ipynb` is optimized for Kaggle submissions:

### 4.1 Key Inference Steps

1. **Model Loading and Preparation**:
   - Load model weights from checkpoint
   - Patch model with enhanced positional encoding for long sequences
   - Move model to appropriate device (GPU if available)

2. **Data Loading**:
   - Load test sequences first to determine their lengths
   - Create adaptive batch sizes based on sequence lengths
   - Use robust feature loading with appropriate defaults

3. **Inference Execution**:
   - Generate multiple conformation samples per sequence
   - Apply temperature for sampling diversity
   - Use mixed precision for memory efficiency
   - Explicit memory cleanup between batches

4. **Result Formatting**:
   - Combine multiple conformations
   - Format as required for Kaggle submission (ID, residue info, 5 sets of coordinates)
   - Generate metadata for submission tracking

### 4.2 Memory Optimization During Inference

1. **Enhanced Positional Encoding**: Dynamically extends for sequences longer than the training length
2. **Tensor Cleanup**: Explicit memory freeing between processing steps
3. **Adaptive Batch Size**: Smaller batches for longer sequences
4. **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of OOM errors with batch fallback

### 4.3 P100 GPU Optimizations

```python
# Memory optimization for Kaggle P100 GPU
import os
os.environ["PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF"] = "expandable_segments:True,max_split_size_mb:512"
```

## 5. Validation Metrics and Approach

### 5.1 Validation Modes

The model implements dual-mode validation:

1. **Test-Equivalent Mode**: Uses only features available at test time
   - No dihedral features
   - Only thermodynamic and sequence features
   - Provides realistic assessment of test performance

2. **Training-Equivalent Mode**: Uses all available features
   - Includes dihedral features
   - Fully utilizes evolutionary information
   - Provides best-case performance assessment

### 5.2 Primary Metrics

1. **RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation)**: Primary structural similarity metric
   - Per-residue RMSD
   - Global RMSD
   - RMSD distribution analysis

2. **TM-Score (Template Modeling Score)**: Normalized structural similarity score
   - Less sensitive to local errors
   - Better for global fold assessment

3. **Secondary Structure Accuracy**: Assessment of base-pairing prediction
   - Sensitivity and specificity
   - Helix and loop region accuracy

### 5.3 Analysis Visualizations

1. **RMSD vs Sequence Length**: Identifies length-dependent performance
2. **TM-Score Distribution**: Shows overall model quality
3. **Per-Residue Error Plots**: Highlights problematic regions
4. **Feature Impact Analysis**: Assesses contribution of different features

## 6. Future Enhancements

- Fallback to default values for invalid inputs
- List-based batch handling for inconsistent lengths

### 7.2 Alternative Execution Paths

The forward method supports both:
- Standard batch processing for uniform inputs
- Individual sample processing for heterogeneous inputs

### 7.3 Padding and Masking

Careful mask propagation throughout the model:
- Masks applied to residue representations
- 2D masks derived for pair representations
- Final outputs multiply by masks to zero out padded positions

This comprehensive architecture combines techniques from protein structure prediction with RNA-specific optimizations, creating a flexible model capable of high-quality RNA 3D structure prediction across a wide range of RNA families and lengths.
