Emily Dickinson: A Biography

Emily Elizabeth Dickinson was born on December 10, 1830, in Amherst, Massachusetts. She lived a largely introverted and reclusive life, seldom leaving her home and communicating with many people through correspondence. Despite her physical seclusion, Dickinson was an avid reader with a brilliant mind, and maintained relationships with a select few individuals who recognized her intellectual and creative gifts.

Dickinson received a formal education at Amherst Academy and briefly attended Mount Holyoke Female Seminary but returned home after a year. Throughout her life, she maintained close relationships with her family, particularly her father Edward, her sister Lavinia, and her brother Austin. Her most intense relationships were often conducted through letters, including a passionate correspondence with Susan Gilbert, who later became her sister-in-law.

Though she wrote nearly 1,800 poems, only a handful were published during her lifetime, and those that were had been significantly altered by publishers to fit conventional patterns of rhyme and meter. Dickinson's poetry is characterized by unconventional capitalization and punctuation, particularly her extensive use of dashes. Her work explores themes of death, immortality, nature, love, and the human experience with remarkable insight and originality.

After Dickinson's death on May 15, 1886, her sister Lavinia discovered her cache of poems, meticulously organized and hand-bound into small packets called "fascicles." The first collection of her poems was published in 1890, though heavily edited. It wasn't until the 1950s that complete and largely unaltered collections of her work began to be published, finally revealing her true poetic genius to the world.

Today, Emily Dickinson is recognized as one of America's greatest and most original poets, whose innovative style presaged modern poetry. Her concise, enigmatic style, with its surprising metaphors and unconventional syntax, continues to captivate readers and influence writers more than a century after her death. Her life and work stand as testament to the power of the interior life and the profound creativity that can emerge from deep observation and contemplation.

En 1815, M. Charles-François-Bienvenu Myriel était évêque de Digne. C'était un vieillard d'environ soixante-quinze ans; il occupait le siège de Digne depuis 1806. Quoique ce détail ne touche en aucune manière au fond même de ce que nous avons à raconter, il n'est peut-être pas inutile, ne fût-ce que pour être exact en tout, d'indiquer ici les bruits et les propos qui avaient couru sur son compte au moment où il était arrivé dans le diocèse.
