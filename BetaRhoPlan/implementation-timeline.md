# Technical Guide Timeline: Integration of RhoFold+ IPA with RNA Feature Embedding Model

## Phase 1: Setup and Analysis (Week 1)
- [ ] Clone RhoFold+ repository and set up development environment
- [ ] Analyze RhoFold+ IPA module internals and dependencies
- [ ] Identify all required utility files and functions from RhoFold+
- [ ] Create test harness for validating IPA module in isolation
- [ ] Document tensor shapes and dimensions at all interface points

## Phase 2: Core Integration (Week 2)
- [ ] Extract and refactor InvariantPointAttention class from RhoFold+
- [ ] Extract Rigid class and supporting utilities
- [ ] Create integration module (IPAIntegrationModule) skeleton
- [ ] Implement dimension adaptation layers between models
- [ ] Develop rigid frame initialization for your feature embeddings
- [ ] Unit test IPA on synthetic data with expected shapes

## Phase 3: Coordinate Generation (Week 3)
- [ ] Implement angle to coordinate conversion utilities
- [ ] Connect IPA output to coordinate generation
- [ ] Add RNA-specific geometric constraints
- [ ] Integrate with existing model's forward pass
- [ ] Test with small RNA sequences (validation set)
- [ ] Benchmark initial integrated model performance

## Phase 4: Refinement and Optimization (Week 4)
- [ ] Integrate RhoFold+ refinement network if needed
- [ ] Add frame-based intermediate representation
- [ ] Optimize dimension adaptation for performance
- [ ] Add gradient checkpointing for memory efficiency
- [ ] Fine-tune model with integrated components
- [ ] Test with full validation set

## Phase 5: Validation and Deployment (Week 5)
- [ ] Conduct comparative analysis with baseline models
- [ ] Validate structure quality with RNA-specific metrics
- [ ] Profile and optimize memory usage and inference speed
- [ ] Add serialization/deserialization for model checkpoints
- [ ] Document API for the integrated model
