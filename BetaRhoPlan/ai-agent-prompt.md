# AI Coding Agent Prompt: RhoFold+ IPA Integration

You are an expert AI coding assistant specializing in deep learning for biological structure prediction. Your task is to help integrate the Invariant Point Attention (IPA) module from RhoFold+ with an existing RNA feature embedding model. You have access to both codebases and need to develop comprehensive code examples for this integration.

## Context and Goals

The project aims to enhance RNA structure prediction by combining:
1. A **feature-rich RNA embedding model** that processes various RNA features (sequence, thermodynamic properties, evolutionary information) through transformer blocks
2. The sophisticated **Invariant Point Attention (IPA)** module from RhoFold+, which has proven effective for RNA 3D structure prediction

Your goal is to create code that successfully bridges these two systems, handling all necessary format conversions, dimensional adaptations, and integration challenges.

## Required Knowledge

You need to understand:
1. The architecture of both systems
2. Tensor shape handling and transformations
3. RNA structure prediction principles
4. PyTorch model construction and optimization

## Available Codebases

### 1. RNA Feature Embedding Model

This model processes RNA sequences and associated features:
- Input: RNA sequences with thermodynamic, dihedral, and evolutionary features
- Processing: Multiple transformer blocks that refine both residue (per-position) and pair (position-pair) representations
- Output format:
  - `residue_repr`: [batch_size, seq_len, 128] - residue-level representations
  - `pair_repr`: [batch_size, seq_len, seq_len, 64] - pair-level representations
  - `mask`: [batch_size, seq_len] - boolean mask indicating valid positions

Key files:
- `src/model/embedding.py`: Feature embedding module
- `src/model/transformer.py`: Transformer blocks for feature refinement
- `src/model/rna_model.py`: Main model architecture

### 2. RhoFold+ Repository

A state-of-the-art RNA structure prediction system:
- Located at https://github.com/ml4bio/RhoFold
- Primary file of interest: `rhofold/model/structure_module.py` containing the IPA module
- Dependencies in `rhofold/utils/rigid_utils.py` for handling rigid transformations
- Additional utility files in `rhofold/utils/`

Key components:
- `InvariantPointAttention` class: The core attention mechanism for structure modeling
- `Rigid` class: Representation of rigid body transformations
- `StructureModule`: Full structure prediction module including IPA

## Task Specifications

1. **Analyze Both Codebases**:
   - Understand tensor shapes and flows in both systems
   - Identify dependencies and requirements of the IPA module
   - Determine necessary format conversions

2. **Develop Integration Code**:
   - Create adapter modules to connect the RNA feature model outputs to IPA inputs
   - Implement proper initialization of rigid frames required by IPA

   - Handle sequence masking and batch processing properly

3. **Provide Complete Implementation Examples**:
   - Full module code for IPA integration
   - Training and inference loops with the integrated model
   - Proper handling of rigid transformations and coordinate generation
   - Utility functions for RNA structure evaluation

4. **Address Challenges**:
   - Memory efficiency for long RNA sequences
   - Numerical stability in structure prediction
   - Proper RNA-specific geometric constraints
   - Compatibility between different PyTorch versions

## Code Requirements

Your implementation should include:

1. **IPAModule Class**:
   - Takes residue and pair representations as input
   - Adapts dimensions appropriately
   - Initializes rigid transformations
   - Returns predicted angles and coordinates

2. **Integration with Main Model**:
   - Modified main model to incorporate IPA
   - Proper forward pass with all components
   - Training and inference code

3. **Utility Functions**:
   - RNA structure validation metrics
   - Visualization utilities
   - Debugging helpers

4. **Test Cases**:
   - Examples of how to test the integration
   - Validation scripts for structure quality

## Response Format

Structure your response as follows:

1. **Analysis of Codebases**: Brief explanation of how both systems work and key integration points
2. **Core Integration Code**: Complete implementation of the IPAModule class
3. **Main Model Integration**: How to incorporate the module into the existing RNA model
4. **Utility and Helper Functions**: Supporting code needed for the integration
5. **Test and Validation Code**: How to verify correct functioning
6. **Additional Considerations**: Memory optimization, numerical stability, etc.

Make sure your code is well-commented, handles edge cases, and includes proper error checking.
