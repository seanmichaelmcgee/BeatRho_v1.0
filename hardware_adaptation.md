The 4070 Ti Super provides only 40% of the VRAM compared to the A100, which presents the primary challenge for adaptation. However, it offers competitive compute capabilities with more CUDA cores, which allows for efficient execution if memory constraints can be addressed.

## Memory Constraint Analysis

The BetaRho v1.0 implementation was initially designed for an A100 with 40GB VRAM, requiring adaptation for the 16GB available on the RTX 4070 Ti Super. Key memory-consuming components include:

1. **Model Parameters**: ~50-100M parameters (~200-400MB)
2. **Optimizer States**: 2-3x model size (~400-1200MB)
3. **Activations & Gradients**: Scales with sequence length, batch size, and model depth
4. **Feature Cache**: Pre-loaded features and embeddings
5. **Forward/Backward Buffers**: Intermediate calculations, especially in IPA

## Adaptation Strategy for RTX 4070 Ti Super

### 1. Batch Size & Sequence Length Management

**Implementation Details:**
```python
# Dynamic batch sizing based on sequence length
def get_optimal_batch_size(seq_length):
    if seq_length <= 50:
        return 8  # Shorter sequences allow larger batches
    elif seq_length <= 100:
        return 4
    elif seq_length <= 200:
        return 2
    else:
        return 1  # Longest sequences require batch size of 1
        
# Add to training loop
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for batch_idx, sequences in enumerate(dataset):
        seq_len = max(len(seq) for seq in sequences)
        optimal_batch = get_optimal_batch_size(seq_len)
        
        # Process in micro-batches if needed
        if len(sequences) > optimal_batch:
            micro_batches = [sequences[i:i+optimal_batch] 
                           for i in range(0, len(sequences), optimal_batch)]
            # Process with gradient accumulation
        else:
            # Process normally
```

**Impact on Primary Objective:**
- Dynamic batch sizing will maintain training stability across different sequence distributions
- May increase training time by 2.5-3x compared to fixed batch size on A100
- TM-score accuracy should remain consistent with proper gradient accumulation

### 2. Model Parameter Reduction

**Implementation Details:**
```python
# Configuration adaptations for different hardware
RTX_4070TI_SUPER_CONFIG = {
    "residue_embed_dim": 96,   # Reduced from 128
    "pair_embed_dim": 48,      # Reduced from 64
    "num_blocks": 3,           # Reduced from 4
    "num_ipa_blocks": 3,       # Reduced from 4
    "no_heads": 2,             # Reduced from 4
    "no_qk_points": 3,         # Reduced from 4
    "no_v_points": 6,          # Reduced from 8
}

A100_CONFIG = {
    "residue_embed_dim": 128,
    "pair_embed_dim": 64,
    "num_blocks": 4,
    "num_ipa_blocks": 4,
    "no_heads": 4,
    "no_qk_points": 4,
    "no_v_points": 8,
}

# Hardware detection function
def get_hardware_optimized_config():
    try:
        device_name = torch.cuda.get_device_name()
        vram = torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0).total_memory / (1024**3)
        
        if "4070 Ti Super" in device_name:
            return RTX_4070TI_SUPER_CONFIG
        elif "A100" in device_name or vram > 35:
            return A100_CONFIG
        else:
            # Detect other hardware and return appropriate config
            pass
    except:
        return DEFAULT_CONFIG
```

**Impact on Primary Objective:**
- Parameter reduction may reduce model capacity by 25-30%
- Expected TM-score decrease of 1-3% compared to full model
- Compensate with longer training (more epochs) to recover performance

### 3. Memory Optimization Techniques

**Implementation Details:**
```python
# Enhanced gradient checkpointing implementation
class EnhancedGradientCheckpointer:
    def __init__(self, model, use_checkpointing=True, chunk_size=2):
        self.model = model
        self.use_checkpointing = use_checkpointing
        self.chunk_size = chunk_size
        
        if use_checkpointing:
            self._apply_checkpointing(model)
    
    def _apply_checkpointing(self, module):
        # Apply checkpointing to transformer blocks in chunks
        if hasattr(module, 'transformer_blocks'):
            blocks = module.transformer_blocks
            # Process blocks in chunks to balance memory vs. recomputation
            for i in range(0, len(blocks), self.chunk_size):
                chunk = blocks[i:i+self.chunk_size]
                
                def custom_forward(*inputs):
                    x, pair_repr, mask = inputs
                    for block in chunk:
                        x, pair_repr = block(x, pair_repr, mask)
                    return x, pair_repr
                
                # Replace forward method of this chunk
                blocks[i].original_forward = blocks[i].forward
                blocks[i].forward = lambda x, pair_repr, mask: torch.utils.checkpoint.checkpoint(
                    custom_forward, x, pair_repr, mask)
        
        # Apply to IPA module with finer granularity
        if isinstance(module, RhoFoldIPAModule):
            original_forward = module.forward
            
            def checkpointed_forward(residue_repr, pair_repr, mask=None, sequences_int=None):
                # Multiple checkpoints within IPA forward pass
                # ... implementation details ...
                return outputs
            
            module.forward = checkpointed_forward
```

**Impact on Primary Objective:**
- Enables training with longer sequences on limited VRAM
- Increases computation time by 20-40% due to recomputation
- No impact on final model quality or TM-score

### 4. Training Workflow Adaptations

**Implementation Details:**
```python
# Progressive training workflow
def train_with_curriculum(model, train_dataset, config):
    # Stage 1: Train on short sequences
    short_indices = [i for i, sample in enumerate(train_dataset) 
                     if len(sample['sequence']) <= 100]
    short_subset = Subset(train_dataset, short_indices)
    
    # Train with larger batch size on short sequences
    train_epoch(model, DataLoader(short_subset, batch_size=8), optimizer, 
                epochs=5, mixed_precision=True)
    
    # Stage 2: Fine-tune on medium sequences
    medium_indices = [i for i, sample in enumerate(train_dataset) 
                      if 100 < len(sample['sequence']) <= 200]
    medium_subset = Subset(train_dataset, medium_indices)
    
    train_epoch(model, DataLoader(medium_subset, batch_size=4), optimizer, 
                epochs=10, mixed_precision=True)
    
    # Stage 3: Final fine-tuning on all sequences
    train_epoch(model, DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=2), optimizer, 
                epochs=15, mixed_precision=True)
```

**Impact on Primary Objective:**
- Curriculum training improves model generalization
- More efficient use of computational resources
- May improve final TM-score by 1-2% through better optimization

## Scaling to A100 for Remote Deployment

### Adaptation Strategy for A100 (40GB)

1. **Configuration Scaling:**
   - Automatically detect A100 and switch to full-parameter configuration
   - Scale batch size to fully utilize 40GB VRAM
   - Enable multi-sequence processing for higher throughput

2. **Implementation Details:**
```python
# A100 optimization script
def optimize_for_a100(model, config):
    # Restore full model capacity
    config.update({
        "residue_embed_dim": 128,
        "pair_embed_dim": 64,
        "num_blocks": 4,
        "num_ipa_blocks": 4,
        "no_heads": 4,
        "no_qk_points": 4,
        "no_v_points": 8,
    })
    
    # Reinitialize model with full capacity
    model = RhoFoldIPAModel(config)
    
    # Adjust training parameters
    training_config = {
        "batch_size": 16,  # Increased batch size
        "max_seq_length": 500,  # Support for longer sequences
        "gradient_accumulation_steps": 1,  # No need for gradient accumulation
        "mixed_precision": True,  # Still beneficial for speed
        "gradient_checkpointing": False,  # May not be needed with 40GB
    }
    
    return model, training_config
```

3. **Deployment Workflow:**
   - Train initial model on RTX 4070 Ti Super
   - Transfer checkpoint to A100 environment
   - Scale up hyperparameters and continue training
   - Deploy final model for inference
