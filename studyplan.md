## 1. Executive Summary

This study plan outlines a comprehensive methodology for analyzing path inconsistencies in the BetaRho v1.0 RNA structure prediction pipeline. The analysis will identify issues that could prevent proper data loading during training and inference, and will result in a detailed implementation plan for standardizing path handling throughout the codebase. The approach balances thoroughness with efficiency, focusing on high-impact areas first while maintaining systematic documentation of findings.

## 2. Study Plan Overview

The analysis will follow these strategic phases:

1. **Reference Documentation Analysis**
   - Extract expected data structures and paths from technical documentation
   - Identify stated conventions, assumptions, and requirements
   - Create reference map of \"intended\" architecture and data flow
   - Document the expected working directory and path resolution approach

2. **Source Code Path Analysis Methodology**
   - Sequential file-by-file analysis with templated extraction approach
   - Cross-module path reference tracking and validation
   - Identification of path construction patterns and inconsistencies
   - Comparison of implementation against documented expectations

3. **Data Structure Mapping and Verification**
   - Systematic traversal of actual data directories and file structures
   - Extraction and cataloging of file naming patterns
   - Detection of pattern variations and exceptions
   - Comparison of actual structures against code expectations

4. **Cross-Module Path Handling Assessment**
   - Analysis of path propagation across module boundaries
   - Identification of assumption mismatches between modules
   - Tracking of path transformations throughout execution flow
   - Detection of platform-specific path handling issues

5. **Implementation Plan Development**
   - Categorization and prioritization of identified inconsistencies
   - Development of standardization recommendations
   - Design of backward-compatible path handling solutions
   - Creation of implementation timeline and risk assessment

## 3. Detailed Analysis Methodology

### 3.1 Reference Documentation Analysis

**Approach:**
- Review all technical documentation in `/pipeline/write/BetaRho_v1.0/`
- Focus on `technical_guide.md`, `debugging_guide.md`, and `implementation_timeline.md`
- Extract statements about expected file locations, naming conventions, and path handling
- Create a reference model of the intended architecture

**Documentation Analysis Template:**
```
Document: [Filename]
Section: [Section Title/Number]
Referenced Paths:
  - Path: [Raw Path String]
    Context: [How it's referenced]
    Expected Resolution: [Absolute/Relative, Working Directory]
Path Conventions Specified:
  - [Convention description]
Assumptions Noted:
  - [Assumption about locations/structures]
```

### 3.2 Source Code Path Analysis

**File-by-File Analysis Approach:**

For each source file identified as in-scope:

1. **Path Reference Extraction:**
   - Identify all string literals containing file paths
   - Extract paths from argparse default values
   - Locate path construction code (os.path.join, string concatenation)
   - Identify directory traversal logic (os.walk, glob patterns)

2. **Path Construction Pattern Identification:**
   - Document path joining methods (os.path.join vs string concatenation)
   - Note absolute vs. relative path usage
   - Identify environment variable usage or runtime path resolution
   - Catalog any path normalization approaches

3. **Path Handling Logic Analysis:**
   - Document error handling for missing files/directories
   - Identify path existence checking methods
   - Note any platform-specific path handling
   - Extract file operation patterns (read/write/check)

**Source File Analysis Template:**
```
File: [Filename]
Location: [Full path]
Primary Role: [Brief description of file's function]

Path References:
  - Line [#]: [Code snippet]
    Path: [Extracted path]
    Construction Method: [os.path.join/string concatenation/etc.]
    Absolute/Relative: [Absolute/Relative]
    Context: [Args/Config/Hardcoded/etc.]

Path Handling Logic:
  - Line [#]: [Code snippet]
    Type: [File existence check/Error handling/etc.]
    Approach: [Description of approach]
    Notes: [Any relevant observations]

Default Paths:
  - Parameter: [Parameter name]
    Default Value: [Default path]
    Override Mechanism: [How default can be changed]

Cross-Module References:
  - Module: [Referenced module]
    Path Parameters: [Parameters passed containing paths]
    Assumptions: [Implicit assumptions]
```

### 3.3 Data Structure Mapping

**Approach:**
- Systematically traverse the data directories in the BetaRho project
- Generate a comprehensive map of actual directory structures
- Extract and document file naming patterns
- Compare discovered structures with code references

**Directory Analysis Steps:**
1. Map `/pipeline/write/BetaRho_v1.0/betabend-refactor/data/` structure
2. Catalog all files in `raw/` and `processed/` subdirectories
3. Extract naming patterns from feature files in feature subdirectories
4. Document any exceptions or variations from expected patterns

**Data Structure Mapping Template:**
```
Directory: [Directory path]
Structure:
  - [Subdirectory/File 1]
  - [Subdirectory/File 2]
  ...

File Pattern Analysis:
  Directory: [Specific directory]
  Pattern: [Extracted pattern]
  Examples:
    - [Example 1]
    - [Example 2]
  Exceptions:
    - [Exception 1]: [Description]
    - [Exception 2]: [Description]

Correspondence to Code:
  Referenced In: [Source files]
  Match Status: [Match/Partial Match/Mismatch]
  Discrepancies: [Description of discrepancies]
```

### 3.4 Cross-Module Path Handling Assessment

**Approach:**
- Trace path parameter propagation through module boundaries
- Identify implicit assumptions between calling and called modules
- Document path transformations across the execution flow
- Detect inconsistencies in path handling between modules

**Cross-Module Analysis Template:**
```
Call Chain: [Module A] -> [Module B] -> [Module C]
Path Parameter: [Parameter name]
Original Source: [Where path originates]
Transformations:
  - In [Module A]: [Transformation description]
  - In [Module B]: [Transformation description]
  ...
Consistency Issues:
  - Issue: [Description]
    Location: [Module boundary]
    Impact: [Potential impact]
```

### 3.5 Knowledge Graph Update Strategy

**Entity Types:**
- `SourceFile`: Individual source code files containing path references
- `DataFile`: Data files being referenced by the codebase
- `Directory`: Directory structures in the project
- `PathPattern`: Identified patterns for path construction
- `PathReference`: Specific path reference in code
- `PathInconsistency`: Identified inconsistency between references
- `DataStructure`: Actual data organization pattern

**Relation Types:**
- `references`: SourceFile → DataFile/Directory
- `contains`: Directory → DataFile/Directory
- `inconsistentWith`: PathReference → PathReference
- `implements`: SourceFile → PathPattern
- `violates`: PathReference → PathPattern
- `impacts`: PathInconsistency → SourceFile/DataFile
- `dependsOn`: SourceFile → SourceFile

**Incremental Update Approach:**
- After analyzing each source file, add entities and relationships
- When identifying inconsistencies, create PathInconsistency entities
- Link related inconsistencies to track patterns
- Update impact assessments as analysis progresses

## 4. Prioritization Framework

The analysis will prioritize files and paths in this order:

1. **Primary Data Files** (Highest Priority)
